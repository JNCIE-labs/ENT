## JNCIE-ENT Labs ##

### Purpose ###

This repository exists as a central location for labs written by people
during their quest for the JNCIE-ENT exam.  These labs exist in a
BSD-license compliant form.  Please see the license file for licensing
details and permissions.

### Contributing ###

If you wish to contribute, please open an issue as a pull request
against this repo in GitHub and title the issue appropriately.  
Enter a description of your lab and the request will be reviewed.

To ensure successful acceptance, please submit your lab with the
following:

 - A new directory specifically for your lab
 - PNG- or PDF-formatted lab diagram
 - Markdown-formatted lab exercise
 - Initial configuration files for each device
 - Solution configuration files for each device

At your discretion, you may include a walkthrough of the solution,
but this is not required.  You may also organize your subdirectory
however you wish, although it's recommended that your configuration
files remain in a subdirectory of your lab.

### Contribution Notice ###

> Any labs submitted must be compliant with this repositories license.
> Do NOT submit any labs for which you are not the original author or
> do not have the original author's express permission!

### The Future ###

The organizers would like to see this become a full JNCIE-ENT lab
workbook for future candidates.  A community-driven, freely
available workbook could significantly aid candidates on a budget
or who might need to decide between which books are most vital.

> At this time, this repo is not ready to be considered a book
> or a replacement for any lab guide or workbook.  Although the
> plan is to get to that point, there is currently not enough
> material.  Please contribute if you'd like to see that change.
