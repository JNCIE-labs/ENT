### Purpose ###

This repository exists as a central location for labs written by people
during their quest for the JNCIE-ENT exam.  These labs exist in a
BSD-license compliant form.  Please see the license file for licensing
details and permissions.

### Contributing ###

If you wish to contribute, please open an issue as a pull request
against this repo in GitHub and title the issue appropriately.  
Enter a description of your lab and the request will be reviewed.

To ensure successful acceptance, please submit your lab with the
following:

 - A new directory specifically for your lab
 - PNG- or PDF-formatted lab diagram
 - Markdown-formatted lab exercise
 - Initial configuration files for each device
 - Solution configuration files for each device

At your discretion, you may include a walkthrough of the solution,
but this is not required.  You may also organize your subdirectory
however you wish, although it's recommended that your configuration
files remain in a subdirectory of your lab.
